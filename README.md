# This website was created with React

Hello! I have created this website with React JS, SASS and OMDB API.

Here is a list of features I would like to point out for you to better understand the workflow and the end result:

## Github Pages

You can view the website right now in real time via Github Pages: https://bmfreed.github.io/omdb/

## Fetch API and async functions.

This app uses Javascript's fetch API to get data from the server (the OMDB API in this case) asynchronously.

## React hooks

Because this project was built using functional, rather than class components, states had to be used to manage changes on the webpage. I've utilized useState, useEffect and useRef.

## React-Router

The React-Router library was implemented here to handle page navigation without refreshing the browser window.

## BEM methodology

The BEM (block-element-modifier) methodology is great for predictable markup and avoiding style conflicts between components.

## SASS

Thanks to a large set of super-useful features, such as nesting, variables, ect. SASS played a crucial role in bringint this project to life. It also proved very fitting to use in conjunction with BEM methodology, as it suppornts class nesting.
